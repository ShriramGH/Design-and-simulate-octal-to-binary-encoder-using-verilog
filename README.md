# Design-and-simulate-octal-to-binary-encoder-using-verilog

### AIM: To implement octal to binary Encoder using verilog and validate its output

### HARDWARE REQUIRED: – PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher

### SOFTWARE REQUIRED: Quartus prime

### THEORY
## Encoder
Binary code of N digits can be used to store 2N distinct elements of coded information. This is what encoders and decoders are used for. Encoders convert 2N lines of input into a code of N bits and Decoders decode the N bits into 2N lines.

Encoders – An encoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information in the form of a 2N input lines into N output lines, which represent N bit code for the input. For simple encoders, it is assumed that only one input line is active at a time.
As an example, let’s consider Octal to Binary encoder. As shown in the following figure, an octal-to-binary encoder takes 8 input lines and generates 3 output lines.
